This project explores the classification of Iris flower species based on their petal and sepal dimensions using K-means clustering. By leveraging the MinMaxScaler from scikit-learn, the dataset's features were normalized to ensure optimal clustering performance. The project includes implementation of the K-means algorithm, determination of the optimal number of clusters using techniques like the Elbow method and silhouette scores, and insightful visualization of clustering results.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalization of petal and sepal dimensions using MinMaxScaler to scale features between 0 and 1.
- **K-means Clustering**: Implementation of the K-means algorithm to identify distinct clusters within the Iris dataset.
- **Optimization**: Determination of the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method and silhouette scores.
- **Visualization**: Utilization of matplotlib and seaborn for clear visualization of clustering results.
